**Things that were done well**

-   Short and clean. :)

**Things to improve**

-   It's nice that you tried putting in some login functionality. Only issue is that non logged in users can still access everything. But step by step. ;)
-   How do companies get added to the database? Does this happen manually? Not a problem if that's the case. In that case, would be better if I was provided some data to test.
